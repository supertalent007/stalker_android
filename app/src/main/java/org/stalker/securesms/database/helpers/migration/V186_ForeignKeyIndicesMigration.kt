/**
 * We added some foreign keys to the message table (particularly on original_message_id and latest_revision_id)
 * that depend on the message table itself. But there were no indices to look up messages by those fields.
 * So every time we deleted a message, SQLite had to do a linear scan of the message table to verify that no
 * original_message_id or latest_revision_id fields referenced the deleted message._id.
 *
 * And that is very slow. Like, 40 seconds to delete 100 messages slow.
 *
 * Thankfully, the solution is simple: add indices on those columns.
 *
 * While I was at it, I looked at other columns that would need indices as well.
